Welcome to the **"Rollup Plugin Practical Series"**!

In this series of articles, we will delve into how to learn and master Rollup plugin development and application through practical cases. As a modern front-end engineering tool, **Rollup (version 4)** demonstrates powerful capabilities in module bundling, build optimization, and code splitting. Moreover, its plugin mechanism allows developers to highly customize the build process according to their needs.

The goal of this series is to guide you step by step through a series of practical cases to understand how to develop Rollup plugins and solve various problems encountered in real projects. From implementing basic functionalities to applying plugins in more complex scenarios, we will cover all aspects of plugin development, helping you fully leverage Rollup's plugin system to enhance build efficiency and code quality.

## Target Audience

This series of articles is suitable for developers who already have some front-end development experience, especially those who have used build tools such as Webpack, Vite, or Rollup. If you are already familiar with basic bundling configurations and want to dive deeper into Rollup plugin development or wish to extend your build process through plugins, this series will be perfect for you.

## Content Overview

This series of articles will cover the following topics:

- **Practical Cases**: From simple build directory cleaning to complex plugin development applications, we will gradually introduce how to customize Rollup's build process through plugins.
- **Official Source Code Review**: By analyzing the source code of Rollup's official plugins, we will help you better understand the internal implementation of the plugin mechanism and how to write efficient and elegant plugins.

Through the combination of these practical cases and source code reviews, you will not only learn how to develop custom plugins but also understand how plugins function in real projects, enhancing build efficiency and the development experience.
